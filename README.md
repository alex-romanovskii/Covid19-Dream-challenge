# COVID-19 DREAM Challenge  

### Motivation  
-Testing for Covid-19 is still a major concern in 2020 year. Misuse of testing resources can lead to misdiagnoses for a patient and even to the collapse of the health care system.

### Goal  
-The goal of the project is to develop a machine-learning model for predicting the probabilities of patientâ€™s positive Covid-19. The developed model in this project was trained on based on clinical information available from patient medical records, namely: patient age, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, patient height, heart rate, oxygen saturation, sex, non fasting blood glucose levels (mg/dL), patient temperature, patient weight, neutrophils, leukocytes, platelets, fibrin D-dimer FEU, natriuretic peptide B, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, oxygen , cholesterol and evaluated using both synthetic data and real EHR data from UW Medicine as part of the "COVID-19 DREAM Challenge" competition[1]. Real data represent clinical records from 9500 patients over the last 10 years collected from multiple large hospitals in the University of Washington Medical System including Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center, and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center as well as hundreds of regional clinics across Washington. 

### Result  
-The developed model was evaluated using a ROC AUC and a PR AUC metrics and got the following results: ROC AUC=0.6546 and PR AUC=0.0679.
